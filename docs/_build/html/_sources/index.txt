Hermes 0.1
==========

Hermes is a command-line tool for building and analysing networks. It provides users the convenience to construct graphs from csv files and compile them into ``.gexf`` files, ready to display on the network visualization tool Gephi. Supported analysis for version 0.1 are centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector) and community detection. Computed values from the analysis can be outputted with the graph in the ``.gexf`` file.

Hermes is based on NetworkX and python-louvain.
